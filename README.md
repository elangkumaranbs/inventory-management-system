## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Products Table
- `product_id` (Primary Key): Unique product identifier
- `name`: Product name
- `description`: Product description
- `total_qty`: Total quantity across all locations

### Locations Table
- `location_id` (Primary Key): Unique location identifier
- `name`: Location name
- `description`: Location description

### Product Movements Table
- `movement_id` (Primary Key): Auto-increment ID
- `product_id`: Foreign key to Products
- `from_location`: Source location (nullable for incoming stock)
- `to_location`: Destination location (nullable for outgoing stock)
- `qty`: Movement quantity
- `timestamp`: Movement date and time
- `notes`: Optional movement notes

## üîß Configuration

The application uses the following default configurations:

```python
SECRET_KEY = 'dev-secret-key-change-in-production'
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///inventory.db'
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
```

For production deployment, make sure to:
- Change the SECRET_KEY to a secure random value
- Use a production database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Set environment variables for sensitive configurations
